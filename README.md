conda create --name akhdefo --file akh-defo.txt

###Step 3 Activate the newly created anaconda environment using the below command

conda activate akhdefo

##step 4 run the below command to install the remaining required python libraries.

pip install -r akhdeforequirements.txt

Congrats Now your python environment ready to run the Akh-Defo software

Optional Step: its highly recommned to install Visual studio code to run Akh-Defo software, Although you can run the software on any python IDE as long as you choose the akhdefo conda environment as python interpreter 

If you use jupyter notebook or JupyterLab make sure you have also installed ipython and ipkerenel
